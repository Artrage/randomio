# SECOND MILESTONE PROJECT: 
## rndm hpns

Somewhat disillusioned with the course, I came up with a simple idea for an application. It showcases JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and css knowledge, as required.
Initially, I intended to build an online art gallery and store, however, it only makes sense with the implementation of server side and back-end, which is beyond the scope of the second milestone project.
Thus, we have rndm hpns.
It meets the thematic requirements for the Milestone Project.

1. The goal is to have the user click on *clk m* button.
2. The more the user clicks, the higher the *hpns lvl* count.
3. The image will change *randomly* as the user clicks away.
4. *Clk m*, *hpns lvl* and *counter* are animated and will jump each time the the button is clicked.
5. *The navbar* always stays collapsed, it is intentional.
