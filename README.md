# SECOND MILESTONE PROJECT: 
## rndm hpns

Initially, I intended to build an online art gallery and store. However, it only makes sense with the implementation of server side and back-end, which is beyond the scope of the second milestone project.

Somewhat disillusioned with the course, I came up with a different idea for a simple application. It showcases JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and css features, as required.

Thus, we have **rndm hpns**.
It meets the thematic requirements for the Milestone Project, since it contains elements of a game, and all the necessary technical aspects.
In short, the user 

## WHAT DOES IT DO?
It helps the user increase their happiness level.
1. The goal is to have the user click on **clk m** button.
2. The more the user clicks, the higher the **hpns lvl** count.
3. The image will change *randomly* as the user clicks away.
4. **Clk m**, **hpns lvl**, **counter**, and **wht is rndm hpns** are animated and will jump each time the the button is clicked.
5. *The navbar* always stays collapsed, it is intentional. 
6. **cntct** allows the user to send an email to the developer by filling out a contact form in a modal.
7. The footer contains social media links, **wht is rndm hpns** button, and PayPal donate button.

## UX PROCESS
* The application is a one-pager.
* It invites the user to start clicking on **clk me** button in order to improve their overall happiness by means of increasing the **nhps lvl**.
* This is achieved through the use of fairly simple and unobtrusive design, straightforward navigation, and a pleasant color scheme.

* As the page loads, the few orange elements catch the eye immediately, especially the **wht is rndm hpns?** button in the footer. Once the user clicks on it, a modal will pop up with clear explanations of what **rndm hpns** does.

* The light grey elements utilized elsewhere contrast with the orange without distracting from it, while keeping the scheme entertaining.


## USER STORIES 
**A thirty-something single mother stuck at home during the COVID-19 quarantine.**
She hasn't been able to get out of her apartment for a while, nothing changes, she is feeling down and hopeless.
As she starts clicking on the **clk m** button, the images of galaxies, oceans, outer space and city scapes randomly appear.
The **hpns lvl** count goes up the more she clicks, the animated elements merrily jump.
These visual stimuli along with numeric reflection of the improved sensation of happiness will help her feel a little bit better, while staying distracted from the overbearing reality for a while.

**A father of two who has no interest in video games, and is between jobs**
This app will appeal to him as it requires zero gameplay skills, except clicking on a button, which gives immediate positive results. 
As is the aim of the application, these visual stimuli along with numeric reflection of the improved sensation of happiness will help him feel a little bit better, while staying distracted from the overbearing reality for a while.
Nice colours and beautiful photos always help.
